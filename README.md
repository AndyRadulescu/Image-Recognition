This is a project done for a class I attended. The project is made using JavaFX and OpenCV. First a video is loaded and from it images are taken every 95 milliseconds. The image is filltered several times until the final output. Some of the filters are: Sobel,Gray scale, HSV, Erosion, Dilation. The image is also cropped to show the correct output.
